## Remote Notification Certificate

To push a remote notification to iOS devices, the developer should prepare a p12 certificate file as follows.

### 1. Create a CSR file.

In the Applications folder on your Mac, open the Utilities folder and launch Keychain Access.

Within the Keychain Access drop down menu, select Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority.

- In the Certificate Information window, enter the following information:
	- In the User Email Address field, enter your email address.
	- In the Common Name field, create a name for your private key (e.g., John Doe Dev Key).
	- The CA Email Address field should be left empty.
	- In the "Request is" group, select the "Saved to disk" option.
- Click Continue within Keychain Access to complete the CSR generating process.

### 2. Apply aps.cer file

- Upload the CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest file generated as describe in Step 1 to https://developer.apple.com/ios/manage/certificates/team/index.action.
- Apply a file named aps.cer for your application

### 3. Export key.p12 file

- Click the aps.cer file and find it in the Keychain Access application.
- Select the private key, the name of the private key is same as the **Common Name field** when you created the CSR file.
- Export the priviate key as a key.p12 file.
- Remember the password of this key.p12 file.

### 4. Generate aps.p12 file

- Put the aps.cer and key.p12 files into a same folder.
- Generate aps.pem file

```shell
$ openssl x509 -in aps.cer -inform DER -out aps.pem -outform PEM
```
- Generate key.pem file. 
	- Input the password of the key.p12 file
	- Input a new password for the key.pem file.

```shell
$ openssl pkcs12 -nocerts -out key.pem -in key.p12
Enter Import Password:
MAC verified OK
Enter PEM pass phrase:
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase:
```

- Generate aps.p12 file. 
	- Input the password of the key.pem file
	- Input a new password for the aps.p12 file.

```shell
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -in aps.pem -inkey key.pem -name "push" -out aps.p12
Enter pass phrase for key.pem:
Enter Export Password:
Verifying - Enter Export Password:$
```
